# Module to find HEALPix on the system
# It looks for HEALPix components, such as:
# sharp, f90, cxx, c 
#
# Usage:
#   find_package(HEALPIX [version number] [REQUIRED] [QUIET] [COMPONENTS] [list of all components])
#
# Supported components are:
# SHARP, Fortran, CXX, C
#
# The following variables are defined:
#   HEALPIX_FOUND               set to TRUE if HEALPix is found on the system;
#   HEALPIX_[COMPONENT]_FOUND   set to TRUE if component is found on the system;
#   HEALPIX_LIBRARIES           complete list (with all found components) of HEALPIX libs' directory paths;
#   HEALPIX_[COMPONENT]_LIB     full path to one of the components;
#   HEALPIX_INCLUDE_DIRS        HEALPIX include directory paths;
