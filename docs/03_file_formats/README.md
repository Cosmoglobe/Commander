# File Formats

In addition to the main Commander parameter file, the various Commander inputs may grouped into four main categories of files:
- *High-level data files*: Files used during component separation. Examples include frequency and noise maps; beams and pixel windows; and bandpasses.
- *Low-level data files*: Files used during TOD processing. Examples include uncalibrated compressed TOD files; TOD filelists; and instrument description files.
- *Model-specific files*: Files used to describe individual components. Examples include SED templates; angular power spectrum files; and point source catalogs.
- *MCMC tuning files*: Files used to tune individual Commander sampling steps. Examples include bandpass or spectral index MCMC proposal files.

All necessary files are described in the present chapter.
