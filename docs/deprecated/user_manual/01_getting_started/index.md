title: Getting Started

## Getting Started

To get started with Commander3 you first need to installed in your system.
The easiest way is to use cmake installation, which will fetch, download
and install all necessary commander dependecies alongside with commander as well.
Alternatively, you can install all of the dependencies manually and then compile
commander from source. The next section will describe the installation process
in better detail.
