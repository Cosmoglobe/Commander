# Getting Started

To get started with Commander3, you will need two things:

* A list of input files to work with.
* A compiled version of Commander.

Regarding the input files, we provide a [downloader
utility](/01_quick_start/downloader/index.md) that will allow you to
easily get access to all required input files for a successfull
Commander execution.

Regarding getting a compiled version of Commander you have the following
options:

* The easiest way is to use our [precompiled Docker
  image](/01_quick_start/docker/index.md), based on Ubuntu 20.04 server
  that contains a precompiled version of Commander
* Alternatively, and to cover the cases where a Docker image is not
  appropriate, you can use our [detailed CMake installation
  instructions](/01_quick_start/cmake/index.md), which will fetch,
  download and install both Commander and all dependencies.
* Finally, if you feel adventurous you can [manually
  install](/01_quick_start/manual/index.md) all dependencies and compile
  Commander on your own.

The next sections describes the above processes in greater detail.
