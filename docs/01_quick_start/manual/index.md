# Manual compilation

If you have enough time and desire, you can of course compile Commander3 from scratch. For this you will need to do the following:

1. Determine the locations of your MPI compilers (mpif90, mpif77, mpicc, etc), and ensure that they function correctly;
2. Download and compile the following libraries from source: [HDF5](https://www.hdfgroup.org/) (`version 1.10.0` or higher), [FFTW](http://www.fftw.org/) (`version 3.3.8` or higher), [CFitsio](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/fitsio/) (`version 3.47` or higher) and [HEALPix](https://healpix.sourceforge.io/) (`version 3.70` or higher);
3. Look in the `config/` directory and see if a configuration already exists which is similar to your machine.  Copy the `config` (or the `config.example`) to a new file in the same directory.  Call this new file `config.<machine>` where `<machine>` is the name of the system you will be building the software on.
4. Edit the `config` file and specify all the options for your system. Here you will need to specify the locations of newly installed libraries as well as linking rules;
5. `cd` into the top level commander directory and set the `COMMANDER` environment variable to the string you used above as the `<machine>`.  For example, if your config is named `config.mylaptop`, then you would set the environment variable in `.bashrc` as:
    - For Bourne-like shells
    ```
    $ export COMMANDER=mylaptop
    ```
    - For csh-like shells
    ```
    % setenv COMMANDER mylaptop
    ```
6. To view some additional help about the available make targets:
```
$ make help
```
7. To build and install the software:
```
$ make
$ make install
```
