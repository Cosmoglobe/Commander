# Introduction

[Commander](https://github.com/hke/Commander) is a Bayesian Markov
Chain Monte Carlo sampler for CMB, microwave and sub-mm
observations. It fits a user-specified parametric model, \(s(\theta)\),
to some set of observations, \(d_\nu\), by mapping the posterior
distribution \(P(\theta|d)\) with standard sampling techniques, in
particular Gibbs and Metropolis-Hastings sampling.
