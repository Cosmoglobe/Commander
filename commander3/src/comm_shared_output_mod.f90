! Provide shared output to a single file from multiple processes.
! Basically the same as mpi shared writes, but we were asked not to use
! those, so.. Anyway, we could make this a wrapper for mpi write if we want.
!
! The current implementation uses posix locks and maintains an internal
! buffer to avoid excessive lock operations.
