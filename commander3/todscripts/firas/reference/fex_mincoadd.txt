!  Rationale:  In order to facilitate the taking of a median if necessary, the
!              minimum number of ifgs should be an odd number.  We fear that 3
!              is too small because any statistical quantities generated from 
!              that number are likely not to be meaningful.  Seven is 
!              uncomfortably large because our proliferation of operating 
!              states during the mission will probably cause there to be a 
!              significant number of pixels with fewer than 7 coaddable ifgs.
!              Thus, we compromise on 5.
