Installation Instructions
==========================

First determine the locations of your MPI compilers (mpif90, mpif77, mpicc, etc),
and ensure that they function correctly.  Next determine the locations of the
CFITSIO and LAPACK libraries, and how to link to these libraries.

Next look in the config/ directory and see if a configuration already exists
which is similar to your machine.  Copy this config (or the config.example) to a
new file in the same directory.  Call this new file config.<machine> where 
"<machine>" is the name of the system you will be building the software on.

Edit this config file and specify all the options for your system.

Now "cd" into the top level commander directory and set the COMMANDER
environment variable to the string you used above as the "<machine>".  For
example, if your config is named "config.mylaptop", then you would set the 
environment variable like this:

(For Bourne-like shells)
$> export COMMANDER=mylaptop

(For csh-like shells)
%> setenv COMMANDER mylaptop

To view some additional help about the available make targets:

$> make help

To build and install the software:

$> make
$> make install
